description=[h1] Frequently Asked Question: [/h1]

description=
description=[h2] Does it work on existing saves? [/h2]

description=[h2] My building isn't recognized as an indoor space. What should I do? [/h2]
description= For a solution, please refer to this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbvAJmf9Lg4] video [/url]. And I suggest to use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3202305691] Fix Inside Player Building [/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198329871201] Tchernobill [/url]
description=
description=[h2] I'm missing some items in the build menu. How do I find them? [/h2]
description= To access all available buildables, you'll need to activate them in the Sandbox settings (in single-player you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894296454] Change Sandbox Options (by Star)[/url]), as some are initially disabled, such as metal drums, furniture, etc.
description=
description=[h2] Does it work for all game versions? [/h2]
description= Only tested and working on the latest game version (v41.78.16).

description=[h1] Incompatibilities: [/h1]
description=This mod inherits its core from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515555911]More Builds[/url] by Project Sky. My mod revises object building methods and is [b]incompatible[/b] with More Builds.
description=
description=Glass items and methods to create them are sourced from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/orcicorn]Orc[/url]'s mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800412098]Improvised Glass[/url]. Which is [b]incompatible[/b] with this mod, because the windows are already added to the building menu.
description=
description=[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2883755057][b] 41.78+ Propane Torch Fix [/b][/url] is redundant because Building Menu already let's you modify the [b]Blow Torch[/b] uses in the Sandbox options.

description=[h1] Addons: [/h1]
description=While the Building Menu mod can run as a standalone, I recommend using it alongside other tilepacks mods for a richer experience ([i] each addon needs the tilepack loaded before[/i])
description=
description=Be sure to load Building Menu Mod [b]before[/b] any other addon to avoid any problems.
