description=[h1] Incompatibilities: [/h1]
description=This mod inherits its core from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515555911]More Builds[/url] by Project Sky. My mod revises object building methods and is [b]incompatible[/b] with More Builds.
description=
description=Glass items and methods to create them are sourced from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/orcicorn]Orc[/url]'s mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800412098]Improvised Glass[/url]. Which is [b]incompatible[/b] with this mod, because the windows are already added to the building menu.
description=
description=[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2883755057][b] 41.78+ Propane Torch Fix [/b][/url] is redundant because Building Menu already let's you modify the [b]Blow Torch[/b] uses in the Sandbox options.

description=[h1] Addons: [/h1]
description=While the Building Menu mod can run as a standalone, I recommend using it alongside other tilepacks mods for a richer experience ([i] each addon needs the tilepack loaded before[/i])
description=
description=Be sure to load the Building Menu Mod before any other of the addons to avoid any hiccups.
