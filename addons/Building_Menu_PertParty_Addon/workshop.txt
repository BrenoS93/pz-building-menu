description=[h1] Incompatibilities: [/h1]
description=This mod inherits its core from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515555911]More Builds[/url] by Project Sky. My mod revises object building methods and is [b]incompatible[/b] with More Builds.
description=
description=Glass items and methods to crate them are sourced from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/orcicorn]Orc[/url]'s mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800412098]Improvised Glass[/url]. Which is [b]incompatible[/b] with this mod, because the windows are already added to the building menu.
