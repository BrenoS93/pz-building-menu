-- -=[ Instructions for Contributors ]=-
-- First and foremost, a big thank you for your interest and contribution.

-- Follow these steps to contribute your translations:
---- 1. Check for a language directory in "/media/lua/client/shared/Translate/". If it doesn't exist, create one for your language.
------ 1a. Copy these files into your language's directory, located at "Translate/<LANGUAGE>", and rename them as:
------          "IGUI_<LANGUAGE>". (e.g., IGUI_EN.txt)
------          "ContextMenu_<LANGUAGE>.txt".  (e.g., ContextMenu_EN.txt)
------          "Items_<LANGUAGE>.txt".  (e.g., Items_EN.txt)
------          "Recipes_<LANGUAGE>.txt".  (e.g., Recipes_EN.txt)
------          "Sandbox_<LANGUAGE>.txt".  (e.g., Sandbox_EN.txt)
------          "Tooltip_<LANGUAGE>.txt".  (e.g., Tooltip_EN.txt)

---- 2. The 'header' in the instructions must correspond with the name of the text file.
------ For instance, both the text file and its header should be labeled as IGUI_EN, IGUI_RU, IGUI_FR, etc.

---- 3. Begin translating!

-- Translation Files:
--- You'll find the lines that require translation in "/media/lua/client/shared/Translate/<YOUR_LANGUAGE_FOLDER>". 
--- This folder (e.g., EN, RU, FR) will contain all necessary files.

-- Important Note:
--- Ensure the table header "IGUI_XX" aligns with the in-game language abbreviation used by Project Zomboid.
