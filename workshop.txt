description=[h1] Incompatibilities: [/h1]
description=This mod inherits its core from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515555911]More Builds[/url] by Project Sky. My mod revises object building methods and is [b]incompatible[/b] with More Builds.
description=
description=Glass items and methods to create them are sourced from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/orcicorn]Orc[/url]'s mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800412098]Improvised Glass[/url]. Which is [b]incompatible[/b] with this mod, because the windows are already added to the building menu.
description=
description=[b]DO NOT USE [/b] mods like [i]More Builds, Lite, Expand, Improvised,[/i] and such. All can and will cause errors along with the Building Menu, some override vanilla files to add buildables (which is the worst thing they could do) that BM needs.

description=[h1] Addons: [/h1]
description=While the Building Menu mod can run as a standalone, I recommend using it alongside other tilepacks mods for a richer experience ([i]each addon needs the tilepack loaded before[/i]).
description=
description=Be sure to load the Building Menu Mod before any other of the addons to avoid any hiccups.
