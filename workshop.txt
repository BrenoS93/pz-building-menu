description=[h1] Incompatibilities: [/h1]
description=The mod is based on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515555911]More Builds[/url]. Huge thanks to Project Sky for that awesome mod, but this mod overhauls the way objects are built, and is [b]incompatible[/b] with More Builds.
description=
description=Glass panels are from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/orcicorn]Orc[/url]'s mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800412098]Improvised Glass[/url]. Which is [b]incompatible[/b] with this mod, because the windows are already added to the building menu.
